NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.

# Installing NumPy

If you already have Python, you can install NumPy with:

> conda install numpy

or

> pip install numpy

# How to import NumPy

In order to start using NumPy and all of the functions available in NumPy, you’ll need to import it. This can be easily done with this import statement:

> import numpy as np

# Why use NumPy ?

NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types. This allows the code to be optimized even further.
